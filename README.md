A basic web player that shows what you're currently listening to on Spotify. I built this to get a handle on Spotify's Oauth API and to begin to understand their API. Also, to further practice React.

## How to use?
Go [here](https://spotified-react.netlify.app/) for a live demo.

You must be playing music on spotify for it to show anything.
It will ask you to sign into your spotify account and grant permissions to read what you're currently listening to.
It will then display what you're listening to with album art.
